notes:
Upon creating class and id and implementing them in  index.html, I got the following results:
First attempt:
*Element 2 changed color to blue text. This matched the desired outcome partially because the size remained small.  Upon checking it was noticed that a colon instead of a dash had broken the code. Correcting this resulted in text that was the blue color and appropriate size. However, the text is serif and the example is sans-serif so we may need to apply a class further. Perhaps this is the lesson wanted by the creator of the exercise.
*Element 4 changed background to the appropriate green color.It is bolded but not quite as much as the other example desires.
Perhaps we will add strength to it.
We also need to add sans-serif to it.
